# GymRegister 🏋️‍♂️

A comprehensive gym asset registry system designed for quick and efficient tracking of moveable gym equipment using AI-powered scanning technology and modern REST APIs.

## 🚀 Project Status

✅ **FastAPI Backend Complete** - The backend has been successfully migrated to a production-ready FastAPI service with comprehensive REST API endpoints, AI-powered analysis, and modern architecture.

## 📋 Overview

GymRegister is specifically designed for fitness facilities to maintain accurate inventory of portable equipment that can easily go missing or be misplaced. While large, stationary equipment like treadmills and cable machines are not easily moved, smaller items like dumbbells, weight plates, resistance bands, and accessories require constant monitoring.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Gyms face significant challenges with equipment management:
- **Missing Equipment**: Dumbbells, plates, and accessories frequently go missing

- **Inaccurate Records**: Traditional tracking methods lead to discrepancies
- **Operational Disruption**: Equipment shortages affect member experience
- **Financial Loss**: Replacement costs for missing equipment add up quickly

## 💡 Solution

GymRegister leverages scanning technology to provide:
- **Rapid Inventory Checks**: Complete equipment audits in minutes, not hours
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Instant updates on equipment status and location
- **Asset Tag Integration**: Works with existing asset tags (upgradeable to QR codes)
- **Organized Layout Optimization**: Designed for neat, rack-based gym layouts
- **Mobile-First Design**: Scan and update from any mobile device
